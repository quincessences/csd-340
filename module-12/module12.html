                        Gaming has always been one of my favorite hobbies.
                        Having grown up constantly moving, it gave me the ability to always be connected to my friends.
                        Gaming was also the reason I got into coding - I wanted to know how everything worked behind the scenes.

                        Most of the time, I have an unending TBR list that needs to be finished, but things keep on being added.
                        I started reading as a way to escape to a different world, but have since expanded to read everything that sounded remotely interesting.
                        My current goal for reading is 85 books per year, emphasizing different genres and languages.

                        Since I was in university, I always wanted to volunteer and work with causes that are important to me.
                        I have volunteered with animal care organizations, such as shelters, women's rights organizations, and nursing homes.
                        Currently, I volunteer with The Trevor Project to help LGBTQ+ youth navigate the world.

                        To be truthful, I have a varied background in education. initially, I received my BA (Hons) Design Management from Regent's University in London, UK.
                        After I immigrated to the US, I finished my AS in Mathematics from Northeast Community College in preparation for a technical career. At the same time, I finished my Master in Project Management from Bellevue University.
                        Currently, I am completing my BS Software Development from Bellevue University, and pondering a doctorate.

                        Throughout my career, I worked a lot of odd jobs, from legal to selling Kirby vacuum cleaners. My first full-time job landed me in digital marketing at Nestle Nespresso.
                        The majority of my work revolved around capital expenditure on display furniture and project management related to those installations.
                        However, as the world trended to the internet space, I have pioneered the e-corner project, creating cloud spaces on partner websites to include our curated content.
                        For the project, I worked with a partner that provided the majority of the code and edited the received code. Once that was completed, and code was proven to respond to specific websites, I negotiated implementations.
                        Using cloud integration, we added rich content to several partner websites, creating a new digital space.

                        My goal has always been to work in IT.
                        Initially, I started with doing some code work in digital marketing. Then, I got into IT and technical support.
                        Eventually, I have switched to supervising IT technical support, working on processes, training, and technical projects for the area.
                        Recently, I have moved to a job I have wanted for a long time as an application analyst.
                        I am now working on maintaining ERP systems, applications, and API integrations.
